Advantages & Disadvantages

✅ Agile Advantages

✔ Faster feedback & adaptability
✔ Higher customer satisfaction
✔ Early issue detection

❌ Agile Disadvantages

✖ Requires continuous client involvement
✖ Less suited for well-defined, fixed projects
✖ Can be difficult to estimate costs

✅ Waterfall Advantages

✔ Clear structure & documentation
✔ Easier to manage large projects with fixed scope
✔ Well-suited for regulatory and compliance-heavy industries

❌ Waterfall Disadvantages

✖ Inflexible to changing requirements
✖ Issues may be discovered late in the process
✖ Delayed customer feedback until the final stage


### In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

📌 Agile is Best For:

Dynamic, evolving projects where flexibility and continuous feedback are essential.

✅ Examples:
    Software Development Startups – Rapid iterations and evolving user requirements.
    Mobile App Development – Frequent updates and user feedback integration.
    E-commerce Platforms – Continuous feature enhancements and A/B testing.
    AI & Machine Learning Projects – Requires experimentation and iterative improvements.



📌 Waterfall is Best For:

Structured projects with fixed requirements and minimal expected changes.

✅ Examples:
  Government & Regulatory Projects – Strict compliance and documentation required.
  Banking & Financial Systems – High security and well-defined processes.
  Construction & Infrastructure Projects – Requires a sequential approach with minimal deviations.
  Embedded Systems (e.g., medical devices, aircraft software) – Must follow strict development phases for safety compliance.


### What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

 Key Methods for Quality Assurance

1️⃣ Automated Testing – Use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to catch issues early.
2️⃣ Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) – Automate testing and deployment for early issue detection.
3️⃣ Code Reviews & Peer Testing – Improve code quality through collaborative feedback.
4️⃣ Agile & Iterative Development – Deliver in small increments, allowing continuous testing and improvement.
